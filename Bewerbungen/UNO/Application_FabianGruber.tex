After several years as a research assistant at the Institute of Geography of the University of Innsbruck, I am currently writing my PhD thesis  with the title \emph{Digital terrain analysis to support field soil survey} and relocating to Vienna. The advertised position  appeals to me in that it presents the possibility to continue working in the field of remote sensing and geographic information science and at the same time represents a new, exciting field of research to which I can apply the skillset I have acquired.

Ever since working as a project assistant at the University of Natural Resources and Life Sciences, Vienna (BOKU),remote sensing and the use of geographic information systems have been part of my work. There, I applied satellite imagery and digital terrain models to map natural hazards, both through visual inspection but also automated procedures. Later as a research assistant I  applied image classification to investigate the areal change of glaciers in remote areas of Tajikistan for a hazard assessment. While I started off with ArcGIS as a student and tutor, I have now specialised on the use of Open Source GIS such as GRASS, SAGA and QGIS, and combine the various tools with Python or R scripts. As a research assistant at the Institute of Geography at the University of Innsbruck, I applied these skills to modeling landforms and soil parent material based on digital terrain models and different machine learning approaches. For the latest research project I was employed in, I worked on assessing the results of an object-based image classification approach for mapping shallow landslides.

In addition to my experience with remote sensing, GIS and data analysis with R, I am also used to, and enjoy, working in teams made up of experts from different fields of research. I have enclosed a resume with references, and would enjoy discussing this position at your convenience. Should you require any additional material or information, I am happy to supply it.

Thank you for your consideration.
